This error suggests that the column 'id' does not exist in the 'students' table. 

To fix this issue, you should ensure that the 'id' column exists in the 'students' table. 

If the 'id' column does not exist in the 'students' table, you can use the following query to get the count and list of students:

```sql

    s.name AS student_name

This query will return the total number of students and their names.

Based on the table names provided, we can see that there is a table named "students". However, we do not have any additional information about Ava Lee, such as her student ID, which would be required to retrieve her information from the database.

To answer the question, we would need to execute a query that joins the "students" table with any relevant tables (e.g., "grades") and filters the results for Ava Lee's information. 

Here is a possible query to get started:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM students 
WHERE name = 'Ava Lee';
```

However, this query may return multiple rows if Ava Lee has multiple records in the database (e.g., if she has taken multiple classes or has multiple relationships).

Without knowing more about the database schema and Ava Lee's specific information, we cannot provide a more specific answer.

The error message indicates that the token "4th" is not recognized. This is likely because the class name "4th" is enclosed in double quotes, which is causing the issue.

To resolve this, you can remove the double quotes around the class name, like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM students WHERE name = 'Ava Lee' AND class = '4th' AND grade = 'A' ORDER BY student_id LIMIT 1;
```

Alternatively, you can use backticks (``) to enclose the class name, like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM students WHERE name = 'Ava Lee' AND class = `4th` AND grade = 'A' ORDER BY student_id LIMIT 1;
```

Either of these changes should resolve the error and allow the query to execute successfully.
